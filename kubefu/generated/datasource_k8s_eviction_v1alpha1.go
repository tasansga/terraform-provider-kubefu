		Description: "Eviction initiates an eviction process, which should ideally result in a graceful eviction of a .spec.target (e.g. termination of a pod).\n\nThe evictionrequest-controller observes intents of all EvictionRequests and transforms them into Evictions. It manages the Eviction lifecycle. Requesters are preserved in .status.requesters even after they have withdrawn their request. If all requesters withdraw their eviction intent for a common target, the eviction will be canceled. Once all EvictionRequest corresponding to this Eviction .spec.target have been removed, this Eviction object will eventually be garbage collected.\n\nIf the target is a pod, the .status.targetResponders is populated from Pod's .spec.evictionResponders.\n\nResponders should observe and communicate through the .status to help with the eviction of the target when they see their state == Active in .status.targetResponders. ResponderStatus struct should then be periodically updated to indicate the progress or completion of the eviction process by each responder in .status.responders. If .status.responders[].heartbeatTime is not updated within the heartbeat deadline defined by the Eviction API (currently 20 minutes), the eviction is passed over to the next responder with a lower priority.\n\nIf there are no other responders and the target is a pod, the last default imperative-eviction.k8s.io/evictor responder with a priority of 100 will evict the pod using the imperative Eviction API (pods/<name>/eviction subresource).",

						Description: "targetResponders reference responders that should eventually respond to this eviction to help with the graceful eviction of a target. These responders are selected sequentially, according to their specified priority by setting the Active state to the TargetResponder .state field. The maximum number of active responders allowed is 1. Eventually each responder can end up in an Interrupted, Canceled or, Completed state. Responders should observe these states in order to navigate their lifecycle.\n\nIf the target is a pod, the field is populated from Pod's .spec.evictionResponders. Default responders may be added to the list according to the target.\n\nDefault responders: - imperative-eviction.k8s.io/evictor responder with a priority of 100 is added to the list if the\n  target is a pod. It will call the imperative Eviction API (pods/<name>/eviction subresource).\n  This call may not succeed due to PodDisruptionBudgets, which may block the pod termination.\n  It will update the responder message and try again with a backoff.\n\nThe maximum length of the responders list is 11. The length and keys of the list cannot change once set. This field is managed by evictionrequest-controller.",

ResponderStatus fields\n  should be periodically updated to indicate the progress or completion of the eviction process.\n  If .status.responders[].heartbeatTime field is not updated within the heartbeat deadline defined\n  by the Eviction API (currently 20 minutes), the eviction is passed over to the next responder\n\t with a lower priority. Only one responder can be active at a time.\n- Interrupted means that the responder has failed to start or failed to update\n  heartbeatTime in ResponderStatus in a timely manner.\n- Canceled means that the responder has been canceled. In other words, there\tis no\n  EvictionRequest with the same target and Eviction intent in .spec.intent.\n- Completed means that the responder has successfully completed and set completionTime\n  in ResponderStatus.\n\nPlease refer to the ResponderStatus in .status.responders for more details on each responder.",
